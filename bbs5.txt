Ways to have "feedback from the environment":

    1. Electronic Sensor
        - Motion detector
        - Line following sensor (on robot)
        - Camera + face recognition
        - Temperature sensor
    2. Public API
    3. Python input()s
    4. Website:
        get button pressed
        get text box
        get slider


Ways to output back to the environment:

    1. print()
    2. GPIO pins
        - LEDs (even multiple)
        - motors (particularly in the drive base)
    3. Make a sound :)
    4. Website: change text


IDEAS
    - Ring Doorbell - If there is the "correct" face, make a LED blink 
    - Have 5 LEDs, and turn on as many LEDs as there are faces in a picture

        - 1 input and 1 output

PREFERRED:

Adrian 
    - Take a picture and post it to the website
    - Whenever someone posts, an LED blinks
Akhil 
    - Input a link
- if the link is a credible source of information, then it blinks an LED and make the site say "it's a reliable source"
    - else [...]
Danny 
    - when website button, something on site turns green and LED turns on and plays sound
Mark 
    - Generate a random password
    - If wrong password, tell user to reload page
